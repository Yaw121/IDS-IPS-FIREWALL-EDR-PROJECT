<details><b><summary>OBJECTIVE</summary></b>

The objective of this project is to design, implement, and analyze a comprehensive network security architecture utilizing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions, and firewalls. This lab on LetsDefend aims to:

Simulate real-world attack scenarios to evaluate the effectiveness of IDS/IPS in detecting and preventing malicious activities, including unauthorized access, malware infiltration, and brute force attacks.
Implement DLP solutions to monitor, detect, and prevent sensitive data exfiltration and enforce organizational compliance policies.
Deploy EDR solutions to identify and mitigate endpoint threats, ensuring rapid detection and response to suspicious activities across multiple systems.
Configure and test firewall rules and policies to secure the network perimeter while ensuring proper segmentation and access control.
Analyze security logs and alerts generated by IDS/IPS, DLP, EDR, and firewall systems to correlate events, identify patterns, and develop actionable insights for threat mitigation.
Document configurations, findings, and mitigation strategies, providing a structured approach to securing enterprise environments against evolving cyber threats.
